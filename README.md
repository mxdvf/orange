# SuperfastKV

A persistent, embeddable key-value storage engine written in Go. Built from scratch using first principles.

This project was built for the sake of learning how storage engines work under the hood. <br>
And so correctness > speed.

## What it is

A storage engine built to understand what happens underneath databases. No frameworks, no abstractions borrowed from elsewhere — everything from the disk layout to the write-ahead log is implemented from scratch. The name is aspirational I know, but v1 is about getting it right.

## Project Layout

Pretty messed up for now and it remains this way until we get to setting up the KV store.

## V1

- [ ] Persistent CoW B-tree: CoW enabling lock-free reads
- [ ] Raw syscall (mmap + pwrite) I/O: no buffered stdlib, mmap for reads, pwrite for atomic page writes.
- [ ] CRC32 corruption detection: every page is checksummed on write and verified on read.
- [ ] Free list management: reclaims pages from deleted or CoW-replaced nodes.
- [ ] Write-ahead log (WAL): crash recovery via a sequential log.
- [ ] fsync durability: ensure data survives OS crashes, not just process crashes.
- [ ] Benchmarks: and maybe comparing it with other KV stores

## V2

- [ ] SIMD-accelerated comparisons: vectorized key search within nodes, better cache utilization.
- [ ] TOAST-style storage: `The Oversized-Attribute Storage Technique (TOAST)` by Postgres
- [ ] Stratified B-tree: separate hot and cold layers, 100x faster writes, 10x faster reads
- [ ] More to be determined: I don't know what I don't know
